This is an ArcMap add-in to fix things that have a coordinate location but not a point location in a feature layer.

There is currently one button, and it does not have a button icon or anything.  That button fixes the shape based
on the X and Y fields in the table.

NOTE: To use this, you must edit the source.  The destination layer is hard-coded as CountStations.  You may also
wish to change the X and Y fields to something else.

NOTES FOR USE:
This requires ArcMap 10.  Other versions may work.  You can get ArcMap from ESRI,
www.esri.com.  Note that ArcMap is closed-source software, but this extension is
open source.
